# Webbio Assignment - Dec 2018

This repository contains a simple JavaScript full stack web application of Tic Tac Toe. 
It was created with React and Redux in the front end and Koa, TypeORM and routing-controllers in the back end. 
The back end is written in TypeScript and the database used is Postgres. 

The user is able to see whose turn it is and who the winner is, if the game is not a draw.
The game board and the winner can eventually be saved in the database and the game is reset.

To use the app download the repo, install the node packages, compile the back end using 'yarn watch', and you can run it as well as the front end with 'yarn start' from different terminals.
